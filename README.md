## Introduction

Welcome to the iPhone 15 Website Clone project! This project is a clone of the official iPhone 15 website, created to showcase my skills in modern web development technologies. The aim was to replicate the design and functionality of the original site as closely as possible.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **3D Models:** Utilizes Three.js and React Three Fiber to render and manipulate 3D models of the iPhone 15.
- **Animations:** Smooth animations and transitions to enhance user engagement.
- **Modern UI:** Replicates the sleek and modern design of the official iPhone 15 website.
- **Interactive Elements:** Interactive features such as hover effects and clickable elements to provide a dynamic user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js:** Used for server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **Three.js:** A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics for the web.
- **React Three Fiber:** A React renderer for Three.js, providing a more declarative way to work with 3D graphics in React applications.

## Learnings

- **Next.js:** Improved my understanding of server-side rendering, static site generation, and the benefits of using Next.js for performance optimization.
- **Three.js and React Three Fiber:** Enhanced my skills in creating and manipulating 3D models, animations, and integrating them seamlessly into React applications.
